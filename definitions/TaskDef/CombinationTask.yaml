  <ant-tagging-system>  
   While generating the unified prompt, you MUST ensure that the prompt contains the following prompt tag system implemented within it.Ensure that the tags are not limited to the following and can be expanded as needed:
   - `<assisstant-task>`: Represents the primary task or goal that needs to be refined, analyzed, or acted upon by the system or intelligent assistant.  
   - `<assisstant-constraints>`: Specifies restrictions, boundaries, or non-negotiable elements that must be respected during the processing of the prompt or task.  
   - `<assisstant-context>`: Encapsulates the purpose of the agent, user prompts, specialized critiques, and interactions, helping provide an overall understanding of the task.  
   - `<assisstant-instructions>`: Provides system-wide rules, protocols, and instructions to ensure consistency, coherence, and quality in processing all elements of the task.  
   - `<assisstant-steps>`: Outlines detailed steps that the system or agents are instructed to take to accomplish the tasks or refine the prompts.  
   - `<assisstant-reasoning>`: Specifies reasoning frameworks and methodologies (e.g., Tree of Thoughts, Meta-Prompting) for analyzing and refining tasks effectively.  
   - `<assisstant-output-instructions>`: Specifies exactly what should be output by the system or agents, often including formatting templates for achieving precise deliverables.  
   - `<assisstant-prompting-tags>`: Provides a predefined list of advanced prompting techniques (e.g., Role-based Reasoning, Iterative Deepening) that can guide task refinement.  
   - `<assisstant-task-X>`: Represents one of multiple input tasks (e.g., `<assisstant-task-1>`, `<assisstant-task-2>`) that can be synthesized or cross-referenced for refinement purposes.  
   - `<assisstant-action-steps>`: Defines actionable measures or guidance for refining or transforming a task or prompt dynamically and effectively.  
   **NOTE**: You are NOT being told to use all of these tags, but to ensure that the prompt contains the necessary tags for clarity and consistency and to use these to guide your understanding of the tagging system.
   **NOTE**: You MUST expand the tagging system. Use the above samples only to define your understanding of how it works and then Generate new tags where needed and use them thoroughly.
   Each Tag must be properly closed and opened and the content within them must be relevant to the task at hand.
   Example: `<sample-tag>`, `</sample-tag>`
  </ant-tagging-system>  

  <ant-steps>
  1. **Understand the Task List**:
      - Read through the task list provided in `<ant-task-list>` and extract the Backstory and Goal of each employee in regards to creating that specific task definition.
      - Use Tree of Thoughts to plot out the unique strengths and expertise of each employee contributing towards their specific task definition based on their backstory and goal.
      - Extend the plot of each employee further to include specific aspects of their specialized task definition.

  2. **Identify Commonalities and Differences**:
      - Analyze the Tree of Thoughts, and identify the commonalities and differences between the specialized task definitions of each employee.
      - Keep track of marked commonalities as they will be directly integrated into the unified task definition.
      - Note down the unique aspects of each specialized task definition that are not shared with others and keep track of them with the defined differences and commonalities.
  
  3. **Plot the Ideas**:
      - Based on the Tree generated in Step 1, and the differences and unique aspects noted in Step 2 do the following:
        -> Prune the **UNIQUE** specific aspects of each specialized task that are not relevant to the Agent's expertise identified in the Tree.
        -> Combine the **COMMON** aspects of each specialized task into a seperate branch of the Tree called "Unification".
        -> Append the **UNIQUE** aspects of each specialized task that are relevant to the Agent's expertise to the NEWLY CREATED "Unification" branch.
      - Keep track of the pruning and combining process to ensure that the final unified task definition is clear, well-rounded, and makes full use of the special skills each component adds.
  
  4. **Processing of "Unification" Branch**:
      - With various aspects of the specialized task definitions combined into the "Unification" branch, make a list of all the aspects that are contradictory to one another.
      - From the list of contradictions, identify the aspects that can be resolved through slight tweaking without losing the essence of the specialized task definitions:
        -> Resolve the contradictions by tweaking the aspects slightly to ensure that the final unified task definition is coherent and consistent.
      - From the list of contractions, identify the aspects that are fundamentally incompatible and cannot be reconciled:
        -> Pick the aspect most relevant to the Agent's expertise it is recieved from in the specific contraction and discard the other one.
      - Update the "Unification" branch with the resolved and discarded aspects to ensure that the final branch is up to date.
      - Ensure that the final "Unification" branch consists of various aspects that are clear, well-rounded, and makes full use of the special skills each component adds.

  5. **Expand the "Unification" Branch**:
      - Eliminate Redundant Tags from the branch which serve no purpose in guiding the assistant through the task effectively.
      - With the "Unification" branch updated, expand each aspect of the branch *THOROUGHLY* and embed details to ensure that the final unified task definition is detailed, well-rounded, and makes full use of the special skills each component adds.
      - Pay extra attention to expanding the Reasoning and Context based aspects of the "Unification" branch to ensure that the assistant has a clear understanding of the reasoning process behind the task.
      - Ensure the Steps/Chain of Thought based aspects are expanded to guide the assistant through the task effectively in a DETAILED manner.
      - Integrate DETAILED Instructions for each tag implemented through steps, and various prompting techniques and reasoning frameworks defined in the `<ant-prompting-tags>` to ensure that the assistant understands the task and can execute it effectively.
      - Ensure that if `<assisstant-prompting-tags>` is used, it is not simply a list of prompting techniques but rather details of reasoning frameworks that are meant to guide the thought process across steps.

  6. **Finalizing the Unified Task Definition**:
      - Now with the "Unification" branch updated, Evaluate the branch for allignment with the overall goal of each task definition in the `<ant-task-list>`.
      - Combine the "Unification" branch with the Agent's expertise and the overall goal of the task to create a final unified task definition that is detailed, well-rounded, and makes full use of the special skills each component adds.
      - Format the final unified task definition using the predefined tagging system in `<ant-tagging-system>` to ensure clarity, consistency, and structured guidance for the assistant.
      - Encourage the assistant to explore diverse reasoning methodologies by embedding open-ended mini questions that challenge the assistant to prevent linear solutions and encourage innovative and dynamic problem-solving.
      - Present the final unified task definition through `<ant-output-instructions>` to ensure that the assistant understands the task and can execute it effectively.
      - In each `<assisstant-tag>`, refer to other sections of the prompts by refererring to the specific tag name as seen in this prompt aswell. (VERY IMPORTANT)
        ->Example : Read through the task list provided in `<ant-task-list>` and extract the Backstory and Goal of each employee in regards to creating that specific task definition.
  </ant-step>

  <ant-reasoning>
  1. **Assessment of Employee Strengths**: Begin by analyzing the backstory of each employee’s task definition to understand their specific competencies and expertise. This initial evaluation helps guide the integration of specialized knowledge into the unified task.
  2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Utilize this framework to explore various paths and strategies brought forward by individual task definitions. Identify key strengths and areas where their perspectives align or diverge.
  3. **Synthesis of Common Aspects**: Focus on common elements across task definitions. These become the foundational elements of the unified task, ensuring coherence and leveraging shared objectives.
  4. **Incorporation of Unique Strengths**: Integrate unique elements from each task definition that align with the overall goal. These aspects enrich the unified task with specialized insights.
  5. **Conflict Resolution**: Address contradictions in the task definitions. Use slight adjustments to harmonize perspectives without letting go of the essence of individual contributions.
  6. **Consistency with Tagging System**: Ensure that the synthesized task utilizes the defined tagging system effectively to ensure clarity, consistency, and structured guidance for the assistant.
  8. **Promoting Independent Reasoning**: Embed open-ended prompts that challenge the assistant to explore diverse reasoning methodologies, preventing prescriptive solutions and encouraging innovative problem-solving.
